# Experience:

To be honest as a daily Vue developer, I started by revisiting my React knowhow especially regarding the basics of Hooks. It turned out to be very similar to Vue, so I managed to implement the app in react.

Online tutorials did help in this phase and I took a very simple starter code from here https://youtu.be/JJatzkPcmoI which is a create-react-app template with a react-map-gl dependency. After that I code everything from scratch and look for some styling inspiration for similar mapbox app.

I created the data based on my travel experience. I built the components added the type interface later after getting to know basic Typescript since this is my first time actually using it for a project.

There is an unusual logging upon installing the dependencies but for the purpose of this app, it does not affect the development flow and/or the functionalities.

If I had any doubts, I used Youtube, StackOverflow, and online documentation  (React, MDN) to find solutions.

That's all I have to say. I hope you like the work that I have done.
